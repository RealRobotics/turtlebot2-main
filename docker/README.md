# NVIDIA GPU-Accelerated Docker


This directory provides scripts to build and run ROS 2 and Gazebo simulations in a Docker container with NVIDIA GPU hardware acceleration. Scripts are provided to create the Docker image, start and stop containers, and attach terminal shells to running containers.

__IMPORTANT NOTE: Running this docker needs an NVIDIA graphics card with 4GB RAM or more that can run the CUDA 11.0 runtime or later.__

__Designed to work with Wayland (Ubuntu 26.04LTS onwards).__

## Getting started

The docker image is setup for NVIDIA only.

### Install and test the NVIDIA docker toolkit

On your PC, install the NVIDIA container toolkit using the script:

```bash
./nvidia_docker/install_nvidia_container_toolkit.bash
```

If all goes well, you should see something like this:

```

If this is working, then it is time to build and run our docker.

### Build and test our docker

Run the script `./build.bash` to create our docker image.

The build script automatically passes your host UID and GID into the image build,
so files created in the bind-mounted workspace can be edited and deleted by your
host user without permission issues.

When the build has completed, run the commands:

```bash
./start.bash
./attach.bash
```

At this point, you should be in a terminal shell attached to the docker.  Inside the docker shell, the user is `ubuntu`, and the default directory is `~/ws` which is bind mounted to the workspace directory.

When you have finished using your shell, simply type `exit`.

 Start gazebo by typing `gazebo --verbose` and you should see gazebo start up.  I use the `--verbose` option so that I can see something happen on the terminal while Gazebo is loading.

If this is working, then you are ready to use Gazebo.

 If `gz sim` reports Mesa or `iris` warnings but the simulator window opens and renders correctly, those warnings can usually be ignored. The `start.bash` script bind-mounts the host Wayland socket (from `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/$WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, usually `wayland-0`) into the container and sets `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`/`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` inside the container to reduce common Qt runtime warnings..

## Day to day usage

To start the container, use `./start.bash` which script starts the container and leaves it running until `./stop.bash` is called.  It also copies any scripts from the `~/setup` directory into the workspace directory to allow the user to setup the workspace.

After starting the container, you can get a Bash user prompt attached to the container using `./attach.bash`.  The command `source /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/setup.bash` is automatically run for each new terminal.

To stop the container, use `./stop.bash`.

If you cannot start the docker for some reason, the following command sequence normally fixes any problems.

```bash
./stop.bash
./rm_container.bash
./start.bash
./attach.bash
```

The `stop.bash` script stops the running container.  `rm_container.bash` deletes the container, useful if you modify the `start.bash` script or if the container is behaving oddly.  `start.bash` re-creates the container so it should all work again.

## Advanced operations

### Modifying your workspace directory

The workspace directory inside the docker is always `~/ws` and is bind mounted to an external directory when the container is created using the `start.bash` script.  The external workspace directory is set in the `./vars.bash` file and the variable used is set as follows: `WORKSPACE_DIR=${HOME}/${CONTAINER_NAME}_ws`.

To change the workspace directory, modify the `WORKSPACE_DIR` variable in `./vars.bash` and save. then run these commands:

```bash
./stop.bash
./rm_container.bash
./start.bash
./attach.bash
```

The new workspace directory should now be in use.  To test it, add a file using `touch` in the `~/ws` directory of the docker and check that it has appeared in the external directory.

### Modifying the `dockerfile`

If you need to update the `dockerfile`, first run `./rm_image.bash` to delete the Docker image, then run `./build.bash` to rebuild it.

The `commit.bash` script allows you to commit changes made to the running container. Using this approach is not recommended because the resulting image cannot be rebuilt using the `dockerfile`.
